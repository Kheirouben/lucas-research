#	This file contains the master list of all MAVLink Components
#	Each line defines a new component (blank lines and lines
#	beginning with # are ignored).
#
#	The lines are tab delimited and format is:
#	componentIdentifier	systemId componentId physicalAddress
#
#	The component identifier can be any unique string without
#	spaces, however the following convention is advised
#
#	/vehicle_type/uniqueID/componentName
#			(e.g. /aircraft/LU-WOTA/APM)
#
#	The system and component IDs correspond to the MAVLink IDs
#
#	The physical address corresponds to the 64-bit address of 
#	the XBee module to which the component is connected in hex
#	(without leading 0x and capitalised letters) using the
#	format
#
#	highAddr-lowAddr		(e.g. 13A200-40071103)
#
#	If a component does not use the XBee ZNet (and thus does not
#	require an address), use 0-0
